 stuning even for the non-gamer this sound track was beautiful it paints the senery in your mind so well i would recomend it even to people who hate vid game music i have played the game chrono cross but out of all of the games i have ever played it has the best music it backs away from crude keyboarding and takes a fresher step with grate guitars and soulful orchestras it would impress anyone who cares to listen 
 the best soundtrack ever to anything i'm reading a lot of reviews saying that this is the best 'game soundtrack' and i figured that i'd write a review to disagree a bit this in my opinino is yasunori mitsuda's ultimate masterpiece the music is timeless and i'm been listening to it for years now and its beauty simply refuses to fadethe price tag on this is pretty staggering i must say but if you are going to buy any cd for this much money this is the only one that i feel would be worth every penny
 amazing this soundtrack is my favorite music of all time hands down the intense sadness of prisoners of fate which means all the more if you've played the game and the hope in a distant promise and girl who stole the star have been an important inspiration to me personally throughout my teen years the higher energy tracks like chrono cross  time's scar time of the dreamwatch and chronomantique indefinably remeniscent of chrono trigger are all absolutely superb as wellthis soundtrack is amazing music probably the best of this composer's work i haven't heard the xenogears soundtrack so i can't say for sure and even if you've never played the game it would be worth twice the price to buy iti wish i could give it 6 stars
 excellent soundtrack i truly like this soundtrack and i enjoy video game music i have played this game and most of the music on here i enjoy and it's truly relaxing and peacefulon disk one my favorites are scars of time between life and death forest of illusion fortress of ancient dragons lost fragment and drowned valleydisk two the draggons galdorb - home chronomantique prisoners of fate gale and my girlfriend likes zelbessdisk three the best of the three garden of god chronopolis fates jellyfish sea burning orphange dragon's prayer tower of stars dragon god and radical dreamers - unstealable jeweloverall this is a excellent soundtrack and should be brought by those that like video game musicxander cross
 remember pull your jaw off the floor after hearing it if you've played the game you know how divine the music is every single song tells a story of the game it's that good the greatest songs are without a doubt chrono cross time's scar magical dreamers the wind the stars and the sea and radical dreamers unstolen jewel translation varies this music is perfect if you ask me the best it can be yasunori mitsuda just poured his heart on and wrote it down on paper
 an absolute masterpiece i am quite sure any of you actually taking the time to read this have played the game at least once and heard at least a few of the tracks here and whether you were aware of it or not mitsuda's music contributed greatly to the mood of every single minute of the whole gamecomposed of 3 cds and quite a few songs i haven't an exact count all of which are heart-rendering and impressively remarkable this soundtrack is one i assure you you will not forget it has everything for every listener -- from fast-paced and energetic dancing the tokage or termina home to slower and more haunting dragon god to purely beautifully composed time's scar to even some fantastic vocals radical dreamersthis is one of the best videogame soundtracks out there and surely mitsuda's best ever 
 buyer beware this is a self-published book and if you want to know why--read a few paragraphs those 5 star reviews must have been written by ms haddon's family and friends--or perhaps by herself i can't imagine anyone reading the whole thing--i spent an evening with the book and a friend and we were in hysterics reading bits and pieces of it to one another it is most definitely bad enough to be entered into some kind of a worst book contest i can't believe amazon even sells this kind of thing maybe i can offer them my 8th grade term paper on to kill a mockingbird--a book i am quite sure ms haddon never heard of anyway unless you are in a mood to send a book to someone as a joke---stay far far away from this one
 glorious story i loved whisper of the wicked saints the story was amazing and i was pleasantly surprised at the changes in the book i am not normaly someone who is into romance novels but the world was raving about this book and so i bought it i loved it  this is a brilliant story because it is so true this book was so wonderful that i have told all of my friends to read it it is not a typical romance it is so much more not reading this book is a crime becuase you are missing out on a heart warming story
 a five star book i just finished reading whisper of the wicked saints i fell in love with the caracters i expected an average romance read but instead i found one of my favorite books of all time just when i thought i could predict the outcome i was shocked  the writting was so descriptive that my heart broke when julia's did and i felt as if i was there with them instead of just a distant reader if you are a lover of romance novels then this is a must read don't let the cover fool you this book is spectacular
 whispers of the wicked saints this was a easy to read book that made me want to keep reading on and on not easy to put downit left me wanting to read the follow on which i hope is coming soon i used to read a lot but have gotten away from it this book made me want to read again very enjoyable
 the worst a complete waste of time typographical errors poor grammar and a totally pathetic plot add up to absolutely nothing i'm embarrassed for this author and very disappointed i actually paid for this book
 great book this was a great booki just could not put it downand could not read it fast enough boy what a book the twist and turns in this just keeps you guessing and wanting to know what is going to happen next this book makes you fall in love and can heat you upit can also make you so angery this book can make you go throu several of your emotions this is a quick read romance it is something that you will want to end your day off with if you read at night
 great read i thought this book was brilliant but yet realistic it showed me that to error is human i loved the fact that this writer showed the loving side of god and not the revengeful side of him i loved how it twisted and turned and i could not put it down i also loved the glass castle
 oh please i guess you have to be a romance novel lover for this one and not a very discerning one all others beware it is absolute drivel i figured i was in trouble when a typo is prominently featured on the back cover but the first page of the book removed all doubt wait - maybe i'm missing the point a quick re-read of the beginning now makes it clear this has to be an intentional churning of over-heated prose for satiric purposes phew so glad i didn't waste 1095 after all
 awful beyond belief i feel i have to write to keep others from wasting their money this book seems to have been written by a 7th grader with poor grammatical skills for her age as another reviewer points out there is a misspelling on the cover and i believe there is at least one per chapter for example it was mentioned twice that she had a lean on her house i was so distracted by the poor writing and weak plot that i decided to read with a pencil in hand to mark all of the horrible grammar and spelling please don't waste your money i too believe that the good reviews must have been written by the author's relatives i will not put much faith in the reviews from now on
 don't try to fool us with fake reviews it's glaringly obvious that all of the glowing reviews have been written by the same person perhaps the author herself they all have the same misspellings and poor sentence structure that is featured in the book who made veronica haddon think she is an author
 a romantic zen baseball comedy when you hear folks say that they don't make 'em like that anymore they might be talking about by the sea this is a very cool story about a young cuban girl searching for idenity who stumbles into a coastal resort kitchen gig with a zen motorcycle maintenance man three hysterical italian chefs and a latino fireballing right handed pitcher who plays on the team sponsored by the resort's owner as is often the case she 'finds' herself through honest often comical but always emotional interaction with this sizzling roster of players with the perfect mix of special effects that salsa sound and flashbacks by the sea gets 4 big stars from me
 fashionable compression stockings after i had a dvt my doctor required me to wear compression stockings i wore ugly white ted hose and yucky thick brown stockings then i found jobst ultrasheer they gave me the compression i needed 15-20 but looked like regular pantyhose even though my blood clot has been gone for 4 years i still buy these to wear as support stockings because they make my legs feel so nicenote i have problems with the rubberized tops rolling down my thigh i tried the jobst adhesive but i hated having my skin pulled all day i bought an inexpensive garter belt and it works fine and helps keep the stockings from rolling
 jobst ultrasheer thigh high excellent product however they are very difficult to get on for older people i feel like i've had a full day workout after getting them on also as the day wears on they begin to roll down from the top and create a very deep ridge in the skin i have to wear them so if those two difficulties could be addressed it would be such a help
 sizes recomended in the size chart are not real sizes are much smaller than what is recomended in the chart i tried to put it and sheer it i guess you should not buy this item in the internetit is better to go to the store and check it
 mens ultrasheer this model may be ok for sedentary types but i'm active and get around alot in my job - consistently found these stockings rolled up down by my ankles not good solution go with the standard compression stocking 20-30 stock 114622 excellent support stays up and gives me what i need both pair of these also tore as i struggled to pull them up all the time good riddancebad investment
 delicious cookie mix i thought it was funny that i bought this product without knowing it was a mix i read the header very quickly and just thought it was packaged cookies but no it is cookie mix and i guess i should have noticed that since it is right in the titlethis is the first time i have ever tried baking with a cookie mix if you are used to the convenience of the cookie dough that you buy wrapped up in plastic logs then you might be in for a bit of a surprise mixing up the dough can get very messy it is extremely sticky however with a cookie mix like this you have a lot of flexibility in the ratio of ingredients i like to add some extra butter to make the baked cookies more chewy also this mix has really large chocolate chips in it--i love thati removed a star for the addition of 'natural flavors' in the mix
 another abysmal digital copy rather than scratches and insect droppings this one has random pixelations combined with muddy light and vague image resolution probably the cue should have been the packaging is straight out of your street corner bootleg dealerif you've ever seen a reasonably good condition film copy you know the defining visuals of his film are the crystal clear lighting contrasts in black and white the surrounding countryside and 'old home' scenes are set with early morning ground mists or the haze of memory while the events on the bridge and in the water are bright clear and immediatehere everything is dull dark and clouded or if you remember the timbre and enunciation of captain's commands so are the visualsafter that it is hard to believe this award winning critically acclaimed film's best presentation is on youtube somewhere out there is a dvd that comes up to the standard of a 16mm public library reeljust none of them appear to be on amazon
 a fascinating insight into the life of modern japanese teens i thoroughly enjoyed rising sons and daughters i don't know of any other book that looks at japanese society from the point of view of its young people poised as they are between their parents' age-old japanese culture of restraint and obedience to the will of the community and their peers' adulation of western culture true to form the new young of japan seem to be creating an international blend as the ando family demonstrates in this beautifully written book of vignettes of the private lives of members of this family steven wardell is clearly a talented young author adopted for some of his schooling into this family of four teens and thus able to view family life in japan from the inside out a great read
 i liked this album more then i thought i would i heard a song or two and thought same o same obut when i listened to songs like blue angellanna and 'mama the hair just rose off my neckroy is trully an amazing singer with a talent you don't find much now days
 problem with charging smaller aaas i have had the charger for more than two years it charges aa batteries just fine but has a huge problem securing smaller aaa batteries to charge the smaller batteries you need to flip down the little button at the positive end in the beginning one of the four aaa batteries would pop up and now three out of the four won't hold the problem is the flip mechanism became loose and any horizontal pressure would push the buttons back up what i have to do now is using duct tape and a segment of crayon apply the crayon on the buttons and wrap the tape around you know how painful that is
 works but not as advertised i bought one of these chargersthe instructions say the lights stay on while the battery chargestrue the instructions dont say the lights turn off when its done which is also true 24 hours of charging and the lights stay on i returned it thinking i had a bad unitthe new one did the same thing i just kept it since it does chargebut the lights are useless since they seem to always stay on it's a backup charger for when i manage to drain all my aas but i wouldn't want this as my only charger
 disappointed i read the reviewsmade my purchase and was very disappointed the charger is convenient by charging all four batteries at once but the charge only lasts a very short time i now have to go and find batteries that will give me longer life than the kodak nimh aa batteries
 oh dear i was excited to find a book ostensibly about muslim feminism but this volume did not live up to the expectationsone essay among other things describes the veil as potentially liberating it doesn't begin to explain how or whyanother on muslim women in cape town claims that muslim women there are separate but more than equal gee whiz what a disappointmenti had expected and hoped for at least one muslim feminist condemnation of gender apartheid but there is not a single one in the booki'm surprised it didn't have an essay extolling the virtues of female genital mutilation--alyssa a lappen
 based on the reviews here i bought one and i'm glad i did this vcrdvd was an early christmas present to myself after deciding to join the rest of the world in dvd-land but not wanting to let go of my vhs movies quite yet based on the reviews and price and because i own a jvc tv this was my choice i agree with the easy set-up it's a bit awkward to work the whole tvvhsdvd selection options but i think i've gotten the hang of ittwo comments it's not intuitive and actually is pretty complicated too many buttons on the remote but that might please others who are more technically-minded than me so i've had to rely heavily on the how-to manual and setting the vcr timer is awkward -- you can't enter the start and end time but have to scroll unless i'm missing somethingbut those are my only complaints this is a good product for your 
 incorrect disc i am a big jvc fan but i do not like this model i was suspiscious when i saw several units in the return section of the store i bought one anyway new and must say i am not happy the unit sends out clicks to the receiver once in a while the transition between scenes is not always smoothlike a little pause and while it is still fairly new i can't get any dvdcd or even a dvd headcleaner to work all i get is a incorrect disc message
 happy with itbut i'm a jvc nuti have 3 jvc televisions one vcr one bookshelf audio system and car audio system so when it came time to move the vcr player to the boys room and get another one for the old man i knew what make it was going to be i decided on the combo player because i don't think vhs is going to be around much longer i like my combo player except for 2 things1no cable box compatability on the remote control 2no seperate audio video inputs only input for coax cable from my cable box so all of the cable programming is in monowife can't tell the difference in the sound so if she's happy then i'll just live with it vcr and dvd look and sound great
 should be titled hollywood debacle the plot is so ridiculous i have to wonder if they even read the script before making this film the mountain lion breaks out of his trailer - and the cars behind don't notice the mountain lion is captured - and put in a jail cell get real utterly completely stupid
 is this great tv you bet it is hotel babylon is not just good tvit's great tv the show features some incredible acting from tamzin outhwaite formerly of eastenders a bbc soap and max beesley from the ill-fated movie glitter starring mariah carey the show could make for a great drama series but i felt that it is a mix of a drama comedy and soap opera all mixed into a great bbc show the show aired on bbc america for a while but didn't get around to seeing it i can now say that i got the dvd set and all the episodes are great the season finale was an interesting to watchthe show reminds me of hotel which aired on abc from 1983 to 1988 the reasonhotel was set at a fictional san francisco hotel as hotel babylon was set at a luxury five-star hotel in englandi recommend this dvd to anyone who is willing to watch a great show from the bbc
 nothing you don't already know if you have even casually looked into applying to law school have already read everything there is in this book do not waste your money seriously
 unfortunately it wasn't entertaining in the least bit when i first ordered the cd i figured it was going to be a hip cool daddy vibe cd however much to my dismay it sounds like a fourth grade music class the main jist of the cd is that there is a xylaphone playing over peoples voices trying to replicate happening party i believe if i played this cd at a party anywhere in my neighborhood i would get laughed off the beach growing up a surfer in san diego i would not recommend this cd to any of my southern california brothers honestly when i played it i kinda of felt i was in a bad b movie the absolutle epitimy of the cd is the last vibe surf cha cha surfers don't cha
 rochelle explains it all for you wondering what the hell has happened to the moral aspect of modern american culture  this book is a lucid well argued explanation of the simple fact that we have become so totally focused on our individual rights that we have completely ignored and even mocked our personal and public responsibilities the final response and indictment of robert ringer's best seller looking out for 1 this is a great time for anyone who is disgusted with the boorish state of american media politics and discourse in general to clear their heads for the substantial challenges that lie before us not only as americans but as human beings a great book
 more great playing larry's work for the muse label in the late 80s and early 90s found him exploring the rich catalog of jazz standards that he probably grew up playing surrounding himself with the best musicians around larry sounds relaxed focused and totally in control listen to larry's take on my funny valentine and tell me it doesn't stand right up there with chet baker's or miles' a very fine album that you'll enjoy again and again
 doesn't work on a mac it clearly says on line this will work on a mac os system the disk comes and it does not only windows  do not order this if you have a mac
 very frustrating my three year old son was very excited to get this but after two attempts at playing it hasn't been touched since you are not able to use the mouse through any of the games except for the power-up segments instead you are using the up-down arrows on the keyboard - too hard for him and not much fun very disapointed with this game and wish i could return it
 mind numbing this game makes you do the same things over and over it never holds my son's attention long enough to get to the next level there is no choice of games you have to do every thing in order we have another rescue heroes game and both my boys 3 and 6 love it but this one is a dog
 cannot recommend as a former alaskan i didn't want to have to do this but after repeatedly attempting allman's recipes and having to throw out 8-10 cups of flour and miscellaneous ingredients nearly every time--and then comparing to ed wood's recipes which work flawlessly and lisa rayner's very excellent wild bread hand-baked sourdough artisan breads in your own kitchen i can't help but notice that their recipes work where allman's faili'm not a novice baker the only thing that worked reliably was the pancakes recipe but that can be found other places as wellif you are looking for reliable recipes and concise information about starting a sourdough and maintaining it i recommend any of ed wood's books even his very old ones lisa rayner has written a fabulous tome in wild bread but pass on this bookwhile some of the historical vignettes were interesting--not enough so to warrant the cost of the book check it out at your library if you must
 alaska sourdough read most of the book while visiting my brother in alaska loved it i am going to be making my sourdough starter soon book is full of great stories and recipes
 old and good this book is worth to keep in your collection as it does not only advise what to do with sourdough but ruth also told you what the picture of past 100 years ago in alaska where no stand mixer nor any civilized stuffs in kitchen just a pot of sourdough
 autumn got this for my daughter in nc she is now making prefect bread wish she lived closer to make me some
 fast mp3 download of music waxed decades ago one of these 26 songs played as background music on a youtube video of some kind of gymnastic or dance feat out of russia i hunted down the melody read the english lyrics then decided to see what else was in the album downloaded the full album for 15 via amazon mp3 downloader and now happily listen to the melodies interspersed on my ipod
 maybe i got a bad one my experience i got this from fm not amazon the dvd player rattled pretty loudly sometimes but not always when i put in a dvd i tried several the picture quality wasn't all that great and the screen got a horizontal line thru the middle after a short time that would not go away plus one of the other reviewers was dead on about the remote - the layout makes no sense at all very poor human engineering imo i brought it back to the store for a refund i saw the same model under the emerson name for 400 at wm but was hesitant to buy it
 sylvania 6620ldg 20 flat panel lcd tv with built in dvd player light weight space saving very attractive design sharp picture good sound quality and quick response time dvd playback also excellent only negative is its remote control it is hard to read the functions of the keys due to color choices the placement of the keys are almost illogical and you have to look at it carefully before each use it almost seems like it was designed by an imbecil the quality the features and the price still makes this tv an excellent buy
 terrible do not buy this i bought this for my wife for her birthdayand had toreturn it because the dvd palyer would not work i returned it and got a repalcement which once again the dvd player failed to work it is a piece of junk
  beware  this tv is set so that it is not capable of a recall function if you want to flash back between channels this tv is not going to give it to you the remote control that comes with the tv has no recall function so i bought a sony universal which is a much better remote that had the recall button on it however i soon learned that the tv is set at the factory to not have the capability to flash-back it may not be a big deal to some but this user found it very annoying
 kitchen tv i bought this to replace a 13 tube tv in my kitchen what i gained was a larger screen plus relcaiming the counter space the picture is good and the internal dvd player is a bonus all in all a good purchase
 nice for the money the first one i bought was defective the dvd didn't work at all i purchased it from electronics express and when i contacted them they were wonderful they gave me an rma number right away fedex picked it up the next day and a new one arrived 1 week later this one is just fine i really love the clarity of the picture my only complaint is that in dvd mode the sound isn't loud enough i have it in my rv and with the ac running i can barely hear it i solved the problem by running an audio out jack from the tv to the input on the rv stereo speaker system it's very lightweight and easy to move around and store a bonus for the rv the remote isn't great but it works just fine and the videoaudio jacks and antenna input are easy to get to as is the dvd player all in all it's a great deal for the price
 disappointed romanian this book in my opinion is biased and takes an angle of europe that is clean and proper and fails to shed light on the rest of it i can understand that these are tourist guides and why would anyone want to tour a country forgotten by time however i am a very disappointed romanian with this book and would never use it as my reference i have seen travel guides outlining europe exclude romania before but with the precision and detail of dk's series i was left yet again in disappointment
 great travel guide to europe this book is realy great for everybody who likes to travel europe the combination of good pictures illustration and texts is perfect you get a good overall view for the most important sights places cities and countries in europe and also a bit of historical information as a european who already traveled a bit i still could find a lot of inspiration to more interesting places to go thank a lot to eyewitness travel for there great books
 not the best i bought both this and lonely planet and have used lonely planet more because this book is full of pictures but doesn't give you all the info you need also i ended up buying each indiv city guide as well because this one only scratches the surface
 good but received defective book i bought this book because we are moving to germany and i wanted to get a good overview of all the countries in europe that we could travel too unfortunately pages 457-480 on greece are not in english - looks to be spanish there was some sort of printing problem but i found the rest of the book to give good highlights of the countries
 from the label from memphis tn comes the reatards fronted of course by wild kid jay reatard he starting off on eric oblivians label goner at the tender age of 15 jay now 19 is still rocking and offending the sensibilities of his community overdriven loud crackling guitars underlaying jay's southern crooning howl energizes some of the most amazing hate-filled song writing we've heard in years
 either 1 or 5 stars depends on how you look at it either 1 or 5 stars depends on how you look at it1 star because they sent 6 feet of 2 od copper pipe0 star because they won't accept returns on it5 stars because i figure it's actually worth 12-15foot and since they won't take a return i figure i can sell it and make 40-50 on this deal
 hunting the hard way thia was a gift for my husband who loved the book it arrived on the date we were told it would
 disappointing the text is the same as ever i think but the plates are markedly inferior to all previous editions had i known this ahead of time i would not have purchased this volume
 homer or moses an extremely helpful gem on a complex subject of second century religious authority and textual use for anyone serious about this period and the interelation of cultures this book is essential is it complex and detailed of course it must be to argue the point should you buy it yes unless you want to keep running back to the library i write this only after thoroughly disagreeing with the review above
 very poor quality the screen arrived in a cardboard box that was pretty beat up the screen itself is very lightweight very cheesy looking the finish was worn across the entire top of the screen i knew this wasn't solid brass but i expected something that at least looked decent from a distance for the price i paid
 scraped across the whole top purchased this screen last week and it came with noticeable scrapes across the top the box it came in was gigantic with plenty of packaging material but the screen was packaged loosely at the bottom however since it was in another smaller box i'm thinking that the scraping was there to begin with and not from shipping still deciding whether to go through the trouble of exchanging it since another reviewer said they had the same damage i wouldn't want to risk getting another with the same damage and i really need a screen right now other than the damage it's a very nice screen
 unknown africa you don't expect music from africa to be so profesionally produced me from the white world don't understand the lyrics but we do understand the music which is a mixture between salsa soukous and fado with always the african feeling for rithem the soft almost borred voice of oliver n'goma fits pefectly in the music the cd is recorded in france paris you can hear that professionals have been working on the cd a must for a hot lazy nightgreetings arno amsterdam
 didn't live up to expectations i ordered these shoes to replace the previous pair that had ripped apart at the sole clark said they did not make this shoe anymore so i had to order them through amazon sadly the second pair ripped in the same place within 3 months my son has since bought a similar pair from sperry and they seem to be holding up much better
 profound then truly horrible now the narrative style of this work by famous founders' biographer john morse is arrogant flippant and frequently exaggerated it carries the tone of the amateur yankee historian on high passing judgment on this southern statesman who was neither from boston nor a harvard graduate perhaps considered penetrating for its day it really represents nothing more than opinion today the research is so thin that one must conclude that morse wrote the entire manuscript essentially from memory with little reference to the primary and secondary sources we expect of historians now if it weren't for the fact that morse wrote this piece 110 years ago i'd have rated it only one star
 definitely enjoyed this was a gift for my 6 yr old daughter she is a big barbie fan as well as loves to use the computer she is still enjoying this game she completed it in a few hours which worried me at first but she loves to do it over and over again the music is enjoyable and the colors are vibrant it seems to be very user friendly alsomy daughter has not really needed my help to use it once she started it the first time
 even mommy has fun with this one my four year old daughter loves everything barbie and loves the rapunzel movie this game is tons of fun even for a 42 year old we love playing it together we love decorating all the rooms and finding the gems what even better is she can play it alone and i get some me time
 great combination of creativity and adventure my 4 year old daughter has been addicted to this game she plays it over and over again she loves the opening song and has been singing it non stop she gets excited each time she completes a room and finds a gem and loves solving the maze to find prince stefan the only problem is that she sings the song so much i can't get it out of my head
 rapunzel this is such a great game both my 3 year old son and 7 year old daughter love it i like to play to if they would let me so much fun decorating the rooms and so many choices to keep you playing great game not at all what you would think a barbie game would be great fun for all
 not what i expected  my daughter and i loved the movie she is 5 years old and it took her 2 hours to complete the game absolutely no challenge and very little interaction it is essentially just clicking on the screen to make it play the 7 or 8 scenes it has programmed there are no games to play nothing to figure out nothing to do save your money
 barbie rapunzel  crying child my 6-year old daughter is currently sobbing in her bedroom as a result of this rotten gameshe spent an hour on this game painting in pretty pictures and coloring in flowers but halfway through the game the program hung and wouldn't let us leave the room or click anywhere else now even if we exit the game and then start it back up we are frozen in one spot while barbie's disembodied voice urges us to explore somewhere else in the castlestandard software troubleshooting and rebooting didn't help vivendi games' support site is currently disabled and now i'm left with a weeping frustrating child who doesn't understand that it is not her fault that her game won't work i'm hoping it was just incompetent software programming that couldn't catch the bug my 6-year old caught the first time around or maybe they just don't care about the problems so long as you get our 20 bucks if you don't want a crying little girl avoid this game
 barbie as rapunzel a creative adventure i purchased this software for my 5 year old granddaughter and she loves playing it so much she lets me play it sometimes but she doesn't always like what i come up with i plan to purchase other software programs for her
 use your imagination my 3 year old daughter  i both love this software we actually fight over who is going paint the pictures or choose the themes for each room this game allows you to be creative  use your imagination by decorating each room of the castle and finding the missing gems to the prince's crown which gives rapunzel the power to find prince stephan who has been turned to stone  bring him back to life the music  animation is the best i have seen most of the kids software that i've seen is boring to me as an adult but this is not at all i sometimes like to play it without her there are so many variations on color schemes  patterns  that you can never be bored i highly recommend this for girls of all ages
 not so good - ok for a rental this game is pretty exciting and it is very nice and it is really creative and one of a kind the only bad thing is that there is only one castle for the kids to decorate and once you are done with the whole castle that is basically it you either have to create a new username for yourself to do it all over again or you get another game like i did my sister finished the castle in about 2 hours and after that has never even looked at this game anymore it is a nice game and it is fun but it is not really worth that much money
 not os x but mac classic negative this game does not work with os x and requires the cd so you can't have it on multiple computers it is slow i have to tell my daughter that it is thinking a lot this is because it has to access the cd everytime there is a new task you can't view the openning sequence again without throwing out the saved game files some of the tasks and controls are too hard and not user friendly even for adultsit crashes all the timemouse is jumpy and hard to usepositive some tasks are easy possible to use grand and beautifulmy three year has enough patience to survive the multiple trials to get this to work
 bad deal i ordered this dvd and received a substitute i never received the dvd i ordered from importcds the vendor i contacted them and did not recieve any feedback i can't rate a dvd i have never seen i didn't bother to send it back because it would have cost me more that i orginally paid for it in the future i will watch for the name of the person andor persons i am buying from i thought they were a good company i understand a simple mistake but to not get a response at all is not good businees sense i spend hundreds of dollars a month on amazoncom building my dvd collection i guess i will be more careful in the future
 smells divine this is my second bottle of sheer freesia i just love this fragrance its a light delicate sent beautiful like a summer day
 very disappointed this perfume is just awful smells nothing like freesiathe gift recipient was not impressed the worst is that it can't be returned
 creepy wow what people will do behind jealousy and revenge - there are some doors you should not open and if you do - be prepared for what you find behind it
 audio options non existent while the movie in itself was better than i expected what i didnt expect was the non existent thai soundtrack while the option was on the disc menu as well as stated on the package the thai soundtrack does not exist no matter what you choose thai or english english is what you get and while there are some exceptions most dubbing is ridiculous at best and the dubbing on this title is sub par while this review covers only the first movie of the two the other may remain in plastic never to see the inside of my dvd player its a shame and a sham when you purchase what claims to be original and is not very disapointed in this offering from tokyo shock

 ariel litte mermaid with pearl kit arrived very quickly and it is a cute topper however i wouldn't have bought it if they didn't provide instructions i should have listened to the other reviews if you are hoping to get more than the topper do not buy this so annoyed i have this ariel and have no idea how to decorate the cake
 no instructions included - do not trust seller promised with this item are complete instructions and the additional pledge that sweet graces will email you with the supply list and instruction sheets on purchase - so you can be ready ahead of time i received none of this - only a plastic figurine and bracelet to boot amazon claims they can do nothing to help me contact the seller all i got was a phone number for the manufacturer let's hope that yields some results meanwhile i'm wishing i had listened to previous feedback about this unreliable seller 
 why is soulwax ignored by critics  consumers alike i just don't get it - soulwax has been around since the 90s when they released their rock debut on the now defunct almo sounds chock full of should-have-been radio hits and then when while they got some attention for their 2 many djs mash-upremix bootlegs when they return to a full-fledged band as with last year's any minute now critcs  consumers alike barely took notice of that album's amazing writing production and sheer electro-rock power hopefully nite versions a cheeky title recalling when 80s bands like duran duran used to release nite version on 12 of singles for clubs will garner more sales and attention for soulwax - the songs practically leap out of the speakers to grab your neck and turn you head and make you move can't wait to hear what they do tiga on his upcoming sexor debut
 omg soulwax owns wow - this is like the most amazing album ever every track so rocksspecially1 e-talking2 nylipps3 i love techogreat job guysmusicchoice played their whole album this saturday nightand i was jamming to it the whole time going wowone more thing if you're not into housetechnoelectronic then you don't want none of this cause you won't feel it
 slow dull classical 1980's style movie 2 stars of 5 for this slow dull classical 1980's style movie this movie has a young jason bateman in the lead very very very slow and dull with a few moments of bad 1980's style music to our relief the background music which is very annoying is kept to a minimum though it attempts to be an actionsuspense movie it achieves neither i'd suggest skipping this movie
 thank you for releasing it i loved this movie as a kid and i am so happy the powers that be have decided to release it finally if you want to see a great 80's movie this is it
 very not worth your time the book was wriiten very horribly i would never in my life recommend such a book the stories lacked any mystery to them and did not leave me wanting to figure out who the culprit was the only good thing was that none of the stories took up ten or twelve pages
 very fun and educational trains shapes and pegs - a winning combination guaranteed to make both the child and the parent happy good starter puzzle for the 1 yr old range
 ludicrous and silly i remember getting this book so faintly that that says alot about my opinion of it basically while i will entertain lots of odd ideas and theories this book was basically silly
 artistry i think that the deodato concerts are very rich as he used real strings and band musicians as well as you can appreciate the john tropea excelent renditions on guitar
 caution these tracks are not the original versions but are re-recorded versions so whether the tracks are remastered or not is irrelevant
 textbook book shipped quickly and was in excellent condition as stated easy transaction would buy again
 a great book for historical romance lovers this is an engaging a count of life of tess a girl who at a young age washed up on the shore of the isle of may with no memory of the life before then she stays with the old caretakers of the isle after the caretakers are dead a young man colin macpherson washes up on shore colin takes tess back with her to his castle where he helps her uncover her past they are oppositesbut you know what they say opposites attract this book is just one of many in the avon true romance series i have read every book in the series and i know that if you like this book you love the rest this is a great book for girls about 10 to 16 because it is still a romance novel but not what you call a trashy romance novel it is a great novel fokr those who are just getting into romance novels
 yes when i got this book i wasn't expecting much but man was i wrong i loved this book now i may not usually be tied in by a man with long blond hair wearing a kilt but the authors really made colin into this enchanting highlander tess is a very soft heroine while she sometimes seems too guillible i have to remember that it is part of the story this is one of my favorite books in the series
 not the best in the series tess lindsay is content to be the sole occupant of a remote island but when colin macpherson washes ashore her life of solitude gets shaken up tess had always been told to fear strange men but she reluctantly strikes up a friendship with colin soon tess discovers that she has a family she had forgotten about but will she have the courage to leave the island and start a new lifethe beginning of this book is very amusing and the end is decent too but the middle is a big problem the plot loses much of it's believability mostly due to the poor characterization all of the new characters that are introduced are one sided and their behavior lacks reason even tess and colin's development is side tracked in much the same way and their relationship seems awkward and forced the writing does improve towards the end but it's not enough to save the book unless you have your heart set on reading all of the books in the series skip this one
 addonics portable cd drive - i am disappointed in its performance i am disappointed in its performance it seems underpowered and is constantly trying to read cds half the time unsuccessfully i am going to try to return it to amazon
 too uncomfortable and too big these pants were way too big looked about 2 sizes larger and they were incredibly stiff they would have been very uncomfortable for my daughter to wear all day
 very authentic this is my first encounter with yoruba and i have to say that cds are really helping however the book is very short and not particular about certain aspects and details of grammar and other nuances - for someone who never spoke yoruba and doesn't have anybody to ask for a clue it leaves a lot of questions unanswered - for this however there are hopefully other yoruba textbookson the brighter note i would like to add that the book does a very good job in giving a little insight on yoruba people and yoruba culture in general i would recommend it as a good start book for anyone who wants to learn yoruba - you can't go wrong with it
 not the best i agree the cds are a much needed help since it would be impossible to pronnounce the yoruba tones without the help of a native speaker however the design of the book is really poor and confusing i have found several spealling mistakes in english and yoruba and the grammar explanations are very hard to understandunfortunately there are not many teach yourself yoruba books that are worth it this one at least provides basic vocabulary and pronounciation skills
 doesn't fit i ordered this dashmat for a specific vehicle it was not the correct mat i returned the original one and they sent me an exact duplicate of the wrong mat i can't seem to get the correct one and therefore it sits in a box
 you need a good memory i play this with my grandchildren it teaches us both the value of a good memory and is challenging for all you sometimes miss the most obvious lots of fun--tic tac toe with a twist
 kelly club pet parade at hit my daughter loves it my 4 year old daughter loves this game she sings the strike up the band and clap your hands for kelly's pet parade song around the house she can dress the kelly kids train each pet teach the pony to jump etc clean and get the animals ready for the parade paint the elephant's toe nails etc and decorate the floatsall by herself she'll get everything ready showing me everything she has accomplished along the way and then we'll watch her special parade a wonderfully cute game that i highly recommendshe can mostly do the entire game on her own i have it installed on a laptop so she is actually using the inset mouse and can still do the game the only one she has a tough time with is the polar bear catching fish game it's tricky to move your finger on the mouse pad and click at the same time to catch the fish it would be much easier using a regular mouse
 loads of fun my 6-year old and 5-year old both really enjoy this game has lots to do with several different animals to prepare for the parade you get to design a float and it just endless fun graphics and animation are very colorful and cute it's a winner
 easy and fun for 3-4yr olds fun easy game if you can keep it from freezing i've reinstalled it and done everything i know to do to correct the issue it's a shame my 4yr old really likes it
